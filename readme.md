Strangelove Arena

is a standalone reboot of the most gorgeous Unreal Tournement mod ever created.
this project shares the name with the mod.

my vision is for thermonuclear mildly pornagraphic deathmatch that is open source.

map themes include:
Lolshock.com - the almost entire maps plastered with these gonzo pics.
pornstar shrines - single pornstar maps.
cybergoth
gimp
fetish
and other , mostly with sexy themes

maps will be sorted filtered and searched by:
-texture pack just to limit the offensiveness factor.
-license (creative commons/ free / commercial [twitter - @naughtynerdy, i hope i can do yours!])

also there will be 'Clean' maps with thermonuclear themes,
minecraft tekkit (though this is an ADULT game)

map architecture will be boxy, simple and open because people will be
flying around on (as in riding) thermonuclear warheads. im not against the use of curves,
but generally corners are to be used sparingly or as a difficulty modifier.

this is a game that could be made legendary by its community.
the original mod was allready kickass thanks to its community!

currently my current idea is to use the pysoy engine.
i didnt have much luck with the documentation of it, but i did get an image up of some kind.
